This Repo doesn't contain any videos, only some templates in the images folder. The two templates right in /images/ are used, the ones in the subfolders can be used.
Before anything can be done https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8 has to be dowloaded and placed in /Video with Frames/ and video_splitting.py has to be run
You also have to adjust the file Positions, as i haven't done it properly yet and only use absolute paths instead of relative
