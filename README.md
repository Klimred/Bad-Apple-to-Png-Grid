This Repo doesn't contain any videos, only some templates in the images folder. The two templates right in ./images/ are used, the ones in the subfolders can be used.
Before anything can be done https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8 has to be dowloaded and placed in ./Video with Frames/, the audio of the video also needs to be placed as audio.mp3 in ./out/ and video_splitting.py has to be run
